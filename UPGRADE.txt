====================================

Upgrading moderation from D6 to D7
----------------------------------
Moderation offers you an upgradepath from D6 to D7. Follow the upgrade instructions
in UPGRADE.txt from your drupal installation.
IMPORTANT! In order to work, the upgradepath needs the devel module. Please change this lines in
moderation.info to:
;Currently is devel depended, this should be undone sometime.
;dependencies[] = devel
-----------------------
;Currently is devel depended, this should be undone sometime.
dependencies[] = devel

If you dont do that, your installation will break! Don't miss to make backups of your database.
